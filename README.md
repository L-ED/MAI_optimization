For results check, run main.py

For more usage info check main.py -h

How to run experiment:

    python main.py -f {index of optimized function} -o {index of optimization algorithm}

    After start window with function view will pop up, also you need to write starting point into console as X,Y

    Resulting points coodinations and metrics will pop up


Most interesting experiments

    python3 main.py -f 0 -o 3
        point 4,4

    python3 main.py -f 1 -o 0 -lr 20
        point 0,-400
